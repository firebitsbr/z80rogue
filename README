z80rogue, a roguelike game for MSX.

To assemble it:

    tniasm rogue.asm

>> HOW TO PLAY <<

Move with the arrow keys to reveal the area where you are.
Any action is done by touching the target.

Any letter is a monster, the Aardvark monster is the most
easiest of the game, while the Zombie master monster is the
most difficult one. Touching them will cause a battle to
start, press any key to keep advancing the battle and see
how your HP goes down.

The diamonds are traps that will suck your HP.

The clover symbol is food. The square with a hole in the
center is armor, getting more of these means the monsters
will have a hard time hitting you. The up arrow is weapon,
getting more of these means the monsters will receive harder
hits.

The asterisk like symbol is gold, but doesn't affect the
gameplay nor is counted (because lack of space), but I wanted
to have gold in the game ;)

Finally the Amulet of Yendor is represented by a Female sign,
and it will appear only in level 26 or deeper. Once you get
the amulet, the ladders will start taking you to upper levels.

The game will get stuck once you lose all your HP or take the
last ladder to surface.

Enjoy it!
